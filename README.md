# hello-world

Hi seniors! 
I'm SpiderWebWorks,I'm 20 years of age and an aspiring web developer from Philippines.
It is my first time here on github so please treat me well.
The reason im here is that I'm practicing how git works. 
I'm currently studying HTML and CSS, by watching tutorials and reading books about it. 
The thing I still haven't got a laptop, and hopefully I can have mine this December 
so I can practice coding hands on. Can't wait to working with you guys!.
